The main difference between the for's and the while's is a matter of pragmatics: 
we usually use for when there is a known number of iterations, and use while constructs 
when the number of iterations in not known in advance. The while vs do ... while issue 
is also of pragmatics, the second executes the instructions once at start, and afterwards 
it behaves just like the simple while.
